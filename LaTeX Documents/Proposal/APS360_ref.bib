abstract = {Image classification is a hot research topic in today's society and an important direction in the field of image processing research. SVM is a very powerful classification model in machine learning. CNN is a type of feedforward neural network that includes convolution calculation and has a deep structure. It is one of the representative algorithms of deep learning. Taking SVM and CNN as examples, this paper compares and analyzes the traditional machine learning and deep learning image classification algorithms. This study found that when using a large sample mnist dataset, the accuracy of SVM is 0.88 and the accuracy of CNN is 0.98; when using a small sample COREL1000 dataset, the accuracy of SVM is 0.86 and the accuracy of CNN is 0.83. The experimental results in this paper show that traditional machine learning has a better solution effect on small sample data sets, and deep learning framework has higher recognition accuracy on large sample data sets.}

ABSTRACT = {Automated medical image analysis is an emerging field of research that identifies the disease with the help of imaging technology. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a retinal disease that is diagnosed in diabetic patients. Deep neural network (DNN) is widely used to classify diabetic retinopathy from fundus images collected from suspected persons. The proposed DR classification system achieves a symmetrically optimized solution through the combination of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), visual geometry group network (VGGNet), singular value decomposition (SVD) and principle component analysis (PCA), and softmax, for region segmentation, high dimensional feature extraction, feature selection and fundus image classification, respectively. The experiments were performed using a standard KAGGLE dataset containing 35,126 images. The proposed VGG-19 DNN based DR model outperformed the AlexNet and spatial invariant feature transform (SIFT) in terms of classification accuracy and computational time. Utilization of PCA and SVD feature selection with fully connected (FC) layers demonstrated the classification accuracies of 92.21%, 98.34%, 97.96%, and 98.13% for FC7-PCA, FC7-SVD, FC8-PCA, and FC8-SVD, respectively.},
